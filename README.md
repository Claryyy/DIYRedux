# Task 1

1. Create some JavaScript to manage the increment and decrement of the counter
2. Create a variable for the price of product 1 and assign a value of 100
3. Add some HTML beneath the counter to display the total cost
4. Create some JavaScript that updates the total cost based on the quantity and price of product 1

# Task 2

1. Add a second product quantity control, with a different price
2. Create some JavaScript to manage the increment and decrement of its counter
3. Update the total display so it factors in the quantities and prices of both products
